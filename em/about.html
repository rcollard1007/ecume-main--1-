        <h1 id="about-quote"> A story made by the salt and the wind</h1>

        <p id="about-text">Founded in Brittany in 2023, Écume was born from a vision of merging skincare with the wisdom of the sea. After 
            years of studying cosmetic science and environmental management, our mission is to create products that respect both the Earth and 
            your skin. Our small team collaborates with local farmers, herbalists, and artisans, crafting skincare that is honest, effective, 
            and inspired by the strong beauty of the Breton coastline.
