        <h1 id="about-quote"> A story made by the salt and the wind</h1>

        <p id="about-text">Founded in Brittany in 2023, Écume was born from a vision of merging skincare with the wisdom of the sea. After 
            years of studying cosmetic science and environmental management, our mission is to create products that respect both the Earth and 
            your skin. Our small team collaborates with local farmers, herbalists, and artisans, crafting skincare that is honest, effective, 
            and inspired by the strong beauty of the Breton coastline.
        </p>

<p id="founder-text"> Emilie, CEO <br>”For years, I struggled to keep heatlhy skin due to the agressivity of industry’s cosmetic 
    products and I realized that we need something different: products that really care about our skins. Growing up by the sea, I saw 
    both its beauty and the harm humans can inflict on nature. It became clear to me that skincare should be both gentle on the skin and
     kind to the planet”
